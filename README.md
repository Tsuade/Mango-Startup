Item 4A : Experimentation & Priorities, Experimentation (to test OKRs of Strategy)

1/ Create a well-designed Experimentation System that included the strategy, roadmap, and prioritization methodology of Mango in a detailed, specific, and unambiguous way. 
(The strategy enables the team to know what are the main company objectives that they are optimizing towards and how to gauge the success of the tests).
2/ Embracing failure and investing to learn: the leader needs to create a working environment that is comfortable with taking small risks to either validate that an idea is worth pursuing or learn from the behavior.
3/The team members from the product manager to the designers, analysts, and developers will need to be trained in using a singular framework and language, so they will have enough skills required for their fields.
4/Data-driven decision making-Impactful and valid experiments will require accessible data sources to quantify the benchmark performance to measure any 
experimentâ€™s results against. This data allows the teams to make objective observations from the experiments and correctly project the value of the wins as 
well as the impact of experimentation as a whole.
